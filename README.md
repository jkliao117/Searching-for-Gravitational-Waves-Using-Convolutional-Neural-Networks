# Searching-for-Gravitational-Waves-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
A computational research project I completed for my MSci degree in Physics with Theoretical Physics

## Abstract
The detection of gravitational waves from compact binary mergers has inaugurated a new era of astrophysics. To expedite the analysis of gravitational-wave signals, deep learning con- volutional neural networks were leveraged to attain more confident detection and accurate pa- rameter estimation. In this project, both detector noise and gravitational waveform were char- acterised and simulated to generated large, extensive banks of strain data. Convolutional neural network models were then constructed and trained with simulated data. The detection model achieved an overall accuracy of 97.07% and reached 100% sensitivity for signals with SNR greater than 6. Also, it is able to perform single-detector analysis and detect weak signals in noisy strain data. On the other hand, the parameter estimation model obtained average per- centage errors of 13.57% and 15.39% for estimating the chirp mass and luminosity distance respectively. These results suggest that the application of convolutional neural networks is an ideal alternative solution in the search of gravitational waves.
